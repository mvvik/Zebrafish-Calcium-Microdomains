#### To reproduce the figures, download the repository, and follow the instructions in each Figure folder.<br>

Do **not** directly execute any code in <code>CALC</code> folder. <br>

**Note to Mac users:** macOS may block CalC execution due to security policy.
If this happens, open Security Settings, scroll down to <code>cmac6109xM1 was blocked to protect your Mac</code>, select <code>Allow Anyway</code>, then run the code once again. 
You may have to go through system pop-ups a few times more (just don't choose <code>move to trash</code>).
Alternatively, you can compile the CalC [source code](https://github.com/mvvik/CalC-simple-buffer) and place the executable in the <code>CALC</code> folder.
